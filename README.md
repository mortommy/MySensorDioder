Items and rules used to control MySensor Dioder (Ikea) via openhab (http://www.openhab.org/).
MySensor Dioder (Ikea) is a mysensor (https://www.mysensors.org/) node created by an hacked ikea dioder led strip. The entire project (eletrical schemas, sketches) can be found here https://www.openhardware.io/view/80/MySensor-Dioder-Ikea

I'm using MySensor Dioder via openhab so here are rules and item.
